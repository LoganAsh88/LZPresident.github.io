            Man, I owe it all to Bron man. We made it this far, and when you're about to reach the end you often think about beginning. It was another one of those late nights, and I was chillin' with Bron and he said, "You know Leo I was thinking man, you should run for president, there's no way you wouldn't win." I said, "Thanks man but it really ain't about the glory you know." and he replied, "Yo I know and that's the best part because I know you, and you would make America a better place for sure, you're the best leader I've ever seen." In the end, Bron was the true inspiration for our campaign and I would be nowhere without him. We still have our late-night talks often and he pushes me to be a better version of myself every day.

            Hola, I am the President of Mexico. America is a place that I like very much and would be a great option for myself and my people. Our food will be a great addition to all the people of America and Canada. Also, America will not have to worry about the immigration of our great Mexican people. Gracias, mucho gusto.

            I am in charge of running Leo's campaign. I owe everything I can give to him and his cause. As Leo once told me, "It's only about who stands with you in the burning sun, when they have the choice to stand in the shade," and he showed me just that.

            Greetings, I am an enlightened (Aura filled) individual. Myself and my colleagues do not believe that our identities are important in Leo Zelinski's campaign. He is the only person who has any value in this campaign and he simply is the best man for the job. In short, I spent my infant years fighting heroic battles with my Monk brethren in the deep Alaskan forests and caverns of thieves. I will defend America as I have defended the secrecy of the Bankei Monk Clan. I send my condolences to our enemiesâ€¦

            As the Canadian Delegate we are extremely excited to partner with Leo and the United States to help sales of Maple Syrup  and increase wood production. On behalf of Canada, we do not recognize Alex Musa as a citizen and will be deported back to Iran shortly and will not be allowed back in for the rest of the time.
