            As a high school student deeply passionate about bridging
            communication gaps, I've embarked on a journey to create a video
            chat transcription and translation service. My motivation stems from
            a desire to dismantle language barriers that often hinder seamless
            interaction among people from diverse linguistic backgrounds. This
            project is not just a technical challenge for me; it's a personal
            mission to make the world a more connected place. Outside of this
            endeavor, I channel my energy and teamwork skills into playing
            soccer, where I find another form of universal language that brings
            people together, regardless of where they come from or what language
            they speak.
