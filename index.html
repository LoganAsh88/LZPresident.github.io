      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        The Auracratic Party has strived through diversity over the years
        gaining support from the American public. The party's goal is to
        reinstitute the idea of Manifest Destiny and take what is rightfully
        ours(Canada and Mexico). Expanding our outreach to Canada and Mexico, we
        will have major economic profit through selling Canada's maple syrup and
        Mexico's tacos.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our party is dedicated to creating a nation that the Founders intended
        for us to be. We believe that America has the right to control their own
        destiny and land, and we are committed to protect the American people
        within the shadows, like Batman.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, with an Aura system we will manage America's society so that
        way the crustiest people stay crusty (ANDY).
